These logs are of a 4000 task run with 1000 workers using RemoteTasks. Each task consisted of sleeping a random amount between 100 and 1000 seconds before returning. The workers were started with 4 cores, so the manager very quickly assigned out all the tasks to workers because they all fit from the beginning. Because the total runtime was so long, a lot of workers disconnected, so many tasks had to be restarted. The manager only waited until 500 workers connected before starting. The duty coprocess was not sent out until all workers connected.
