All these logs were generated by running the manager out of ./tmp
logs staring with blast* are normal blast runs where the output is printed to the screen
logs starting with ns* are runs where the output is not printed to the screen and not appended to a file.
logs starting with app* are runs where the output is appended to a file and not printed to the screen.
logs starting with w0 are runs that are the same to those that star with app but the busy wait flag was set to 0  in vine_manager.c vine_wait_internal
